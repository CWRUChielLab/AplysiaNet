Synapse class has been added and Neurons have been modified so the AplysiaNet is now
a class and controls synchronizing the different parts of the circuit. Most time this
week was spent making design decisions for the synapse; a simple set of equations was
devised, as well as a set of differential equations to replace the simple ones if time
near the end of the project. Since I am slightly behind due to unexpected complexity
and midterms, I will catch up over break and at least have Neuron and Synapse working,
if I do not have time to commit more code later today. At this point, though, design
of Neuron and Synapse is complete, just not implementation.

Neurons have been mostly implemented. Much of the code was adapted from Tate Keller's
C++ model in hopes that making very similar design decisions will minimize problems
later synchronizing the two chunks of the neural network. This code has not been
extensively tested, and many variables will problably move over to AplysiaNet once the
network starts functioning. However, nothing major will need to be added. The second
target for the week was to start implementing synapses. Dr. Chiel, Jeff Gill, and I
are discussing the best ways to do this, so we anticipate the actual coding to start
early next week. Efforts are still being made to understand Greg Sutton's code for the
biomechanical model since he is no longer on campus, and some comments are more helpful
than others.

The main class, AplysiaNet, currently creates an Interface. The Interface class supports
all functionality; entry of all 4 stimulus parameters (chemical start, chemical end,
mechanical start, and mechanical end), checks that the entered values are valid, and
prepares to send those values to the network. The Neuron class is not yet started. Much
time this week was spent meeting with collaborators and redefining a poorly explained
aspect of the project; the design document has been updated to reflect these changes.
Also, a circuit diagram was proposed, which can also be found in the design doc.
