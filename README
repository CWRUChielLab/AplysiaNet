The main class, AplysiaNet, currently creates an Interface. The Interface class supports
all functionality; entry of all 4 stimulus parameters (chemical start, chemical end,
mechanical start, and mechanical end), checks that the entered values are valid, and
prepares to send those values to the network. The Neuron class is not yet started. Much
time this week was spent meeting with collaborators and redefining a poorly explained
aspect of the project; the design document has been updated to reflect these changes.
Also, a circuit diagram was proposed, which can also be found in the design doc.
