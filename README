After much grief, I figured out the solution to the stimulation issue. It has been
fixed. The sample circuit is very unstable because of the parameters, but it generates
numerical output, some of which actually makes sense; -65 is the resting potential,
and the output in the absense of input was sometimes -65. At some time steps the output
explodes; next week I should be able to figure out better parameter values. Things
are completely back on target.

Neuron and synapse are implemented except for the stimulation itself, which I am not
sure how to do. I spent quite a while researching and asking around, but I will have to
wait to get a meeting with my superiors to get a solid answer. A lot of debugging
was accomplished, and a test circuit of two neurons and an excitatory synapse was
built. The circuit does little due to the stimulation issue, but it behaves as expected
given that the currents are not changing. The individual methods in the neuron and
synapse classes all seem to work. The neuron class now handles more synchronization,
and the interface actually passes the user input to the network. The input is trans-
lated into current at each time step and given to one of the test neurons. The
stimulation issue should be fixed by next week. Otherwise, everything is back on target.

Synapse class has been added and Neurons have been modified so the AplysiaNet is now
a class and controls synchronizing the different parts of the circuit. Most time this
week was spent making design decisions for the synapse; a simple set of equations was
devised, as well as a set of differential equations to replace the simple ones if time
near the end of the project. Since I am slightly behind due to unexpected complexity
and midterms, I will catch up over break and at least have Neuron and Synapse working,
if I do not have time to commit more code later today. At this point, though, design
of Neuron and Synapse is complete, just not implementation.

Neurons have been mostly implemented. Much of the code was adapted from Tate Keller's
C++ model in hopes that making very similar design decisions will minimize problems
later synchronizing the two chunks of the neural network. This code has not been
extensively tested, and many variables will problably move over to AplysiaNet once the
network starts functioning. However, nothing major will need to be added. The second
target for the week was to start implementing synapses. Dr. Chiel, Jeff Gill, and I
are discussing the best ways to do this, so we anticipate the actual coding to start
early next week. Efforts are still being made to understand Greg Sutton's code for the
biomechanical model since he is no longer on campus, and some comments are more helpful
than others.

The main class, AplysiaNet, currently creates an Interface. The Interface class supports
all functionality; entry of all 4 stimulus parameters (chemical start, chemical end,
mechanical start, and mechanical end), checks that the entered values are valid, and
prepares to send those values to the network. The Neuron class is not yet started. Much
time this week was spent meeting with collaborators and redefining a poorly explained
aspect of the project; the design document has been updated to reflect these changes.
Also, a circuit diagram was proposed, which can also be found in the design doc.
