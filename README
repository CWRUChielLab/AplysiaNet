Biomechanical Aplysia feeding model

The biggest change this week was changing the model from calculating every 0.25 seconds
to calculating every 0.000008 seconds. This brought some pretty major scaleability
challenges, and I'm not sure that my current solution is permanent. This also exposed
some numerical instability not noticible in the small-scale test with fewer
calculations. I have thus decided to hold off on adding more neurons/synapses to the
model until I figure these things out. Here are the tests I am ultimately trying to
pass, courtesy of a mentor:
1. With no input, the neuron should stay at resting potential. While it does not fire,
it depolarizes slightly. I've done quite a bit of testing but can't quite figure out
why, so I am going to consult with my peers. I think fixing this might help later tests.
2. With the synapse off, neurons can be stimulated to fire. This seems to work, but I
want to test the firing patterns more and possibly adjust the parameters again.
3. A spontaneously bursting neuron should be inhibited with negative current injection.
I haven't tested this yet, but I am thinking of adding a simple toggle switch to my
GUI so users can make the current excitatory or inhibitory for each input. Only
excitatory input is presently supported.
The final two tests involve synapses.
4. An excitatory synapse (defined by its parameters) should stimulate the postsynaptic
neuron. This works, but again, I want to test further and adjust if needed. The param-
eters that currently incite proper behavior are not biologically accurate, and I'd like
to fix this rather than just putting in the value that works.
5. An inhibitory synapse (defined by its parameters) should inhibit. Again, this seems
to work, but the parameters aren't right.
The other major fix this week was the synapses. Last week, they actually didn't do
anything, and since I still got reasonable output, I thought they were working. I
tested them more thouroughly this week, found the bug, and fixed it. The only issue
now is the parameters.
I am worried that this will be way too slow with the full size circuit. Rather than
overcomplicating things by building a larger test circuit, as indicated in my targets,
I would like to address the 5 tests and try to make things run faster next week.
Note to the grader: I am officially past the point of generating large chunks of code.
Most of my progress now relies on small adjustments and parameter fitting, so I hope
this document provides sufficient information as to what I've been doing. If you want
more detail, please let me know! I am happy to explain as much as I can.

This is a midweek commit; many synapse and synchronization bugs were fixed, and the
simple circuit works now. I discovered a new bug regarding the number of time steps
required and my current system's inability to store all the values. I have several
ideas of how to fix this, but I wanted to upload a clean copy before messing with the
core of the program too much.

After much grief, I figured out the solution to the stimulation issue. It has been
fixed. The sample circuit is very unstable because of the parameters, but it generates
numerical output, some of which actually makes sense; -65 is the resting potential,
and the output in the absense of input was sometimes -65. At some time steps the output
explodes; next week I should be able to figure out better parameter values. Things
are completely back on target.

Neuron and synapse are implemented except for the stimulation itself, which I am not
sure how to do. I spent quite a while researching and asking around, but I will have to
wait to get a meeting with my superiors to get a solid answer. A lot of debugging
was accomplished, and a test circuit of two neurons and an excitatory synapse was
built. The circuit does little due to the stimulation issue, but it behaves as expected
given that the currents are not changing. The individual methods in the neuron and
synapse classes all seem to work. The neuron class now handles more synchronization,
and the interface actually passes the user input to the network. The input is trans-
lated into current at each time step and given to one of the test neurons. The
stimulation issue should be fixed by next week. Otherwise, everything is back on target.

Synapse class has been added and Neurons have been modified so the AplysiaNet is now
a class and controls synchronizing the different parts of the circuit. Most time this
week was spent making design decisions for the synapse; a simple set of equations was
devised, as well as a set of differential equations to replace the simple ones if time
near the end of the project. Since I am slightly behind due to unexpected complexity
and midterms, I will catch up over break and at least have Neuron and Synapse working,
if I do not have time to commit more code later today. At this point, though, design
of Neuron and Synapse is complete, just not implementation.

Neurons have been mostly implemented. Much of the code was adapted from Tate Keller's
C++ model in hopes that making very similar design decisions will minimize problems
later synchronizing the two chunks of the neural network. This code has not been
extensively tested, and many variables will problably move over to AplysiaNet once the
network starts functioning. However, nothing major will need to be added. The second
target for the week was to start implementing synapses. Dr. Chiel, Jeff Gill, and I
are discussing the best ways to do this, so we anticipate the actual coding to start
early next week. Efforts are still being made to understand Greg Sutton's code for the
biomechanical model since he is no longer on campus, and some comments are more helpful
than others.

The main class, AplysiaNet, currently creates an Interface. The Interface class supports
all functionality; entry of all 4 stimulus parameters (chemical start, chemical end,
mechanical start, and mechanical end), checks that the entered values are valid, and
prepares to send those values to the network. The Neuron class is not yet started. Much
time this week was spent meeting with collaborators and redefining a poorly explained
aspect of the project; the design document has been updated to reflect these changes.
Also, a circuit diagram was proposed, which can also be found in the design doc.
